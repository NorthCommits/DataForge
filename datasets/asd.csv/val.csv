https://futurexinstitute.com/en/reinforcement-learning-and-its-application-areas/,FutureX Institute Reinforcement Learning and Its Application Areas - FutureX Institute,"# Reinforcement Learning and Its Application Areas Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a key subfield of machine learning that is based on an agent’s interaction with its environment and learning through rewards and penalties. This approach allows the agent to learn optimal decision-making policies in complex environments through trial and error. Due to its capability to learn under dynamic and uncertain conditions, reinforcement learning has become a fundamental tool in the development of intelligent systems in recent years. In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment. In certain applications, direct interaction with the real environment may be costly or risky, necessitating the use of simulations or model-free learning methods. Reinforcement learning stands out as a powerful approach for developing intelligent decision-making systems, with strong potential in adaptive and self-learning technologies.",0.72658,futurexinstitute.com
