Instead of just making static predictions on what a user might like, RL-based systems learn to optimize for long-term user satisfaction and engagement. > **Key Strategic Insight:** The primary advantage of RL in this domain is its ability to learn the complex, non-linear dynamics of a data center’s operations. An RL agent in this context learns to make optimal control decisions, such as routing power, managing energy storage, or adjusting consumer demand. > **Key Strategic Insight:** The core advantage of RL is its ability to learn an optimal control policy for a highly complex and non-stationary system.",0.71887,datanizant.com
