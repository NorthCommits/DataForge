Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning training method that trains software to make certain desired actions. Reinforcement learning is one of several approaches developers use to train machine learning systems. Reinforcement learning is also used in operations research, information theory, game theory, control theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics, genetic algorithms and ongoing industrial automation efforts. For example, if a robot that was reliant on reinforcement learning was deployed to navigate a complex physical environment, it would seek new states and take different actions as it moves. * **State-action-reward-state-action.** This reinforcement learning algorithm starts by giving the agent what's known as a *policy*. *Machine learning algorithms use one or more training approaches, including reinforcement learning.",0.7901199999999999,www.techtarget.com

Two main approaches to represent agents with model-free reinforcement learning is Policy optimization and Q-learning. In policy optimization methods the agent learns directly the policy function that maps state to action. Simply as it sounds, these methods combine the strengths of Q-learning and policy gradients, thus the policy function that maps state to action and the action-value function that provides a value for each action is learned.",0.810025,smartlabai.medium.com
