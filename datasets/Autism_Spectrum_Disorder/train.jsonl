The general workflow for training an agent using reinforcement learning includes the following steps (Figure 4): Then you create the agent, which consists of the policy and the reinforcement learning training algorithm.

Two main approaches to represent agents with model-free reinforcement learning is Policy optimization and Q-learning. In policy optimization methods the agent learns directly the policy function that maps state to action. Simply as it sounds, these methods combine the strengths of Q-learning and policy gradients, thus the policy function that maps state to action and the action-value function that provides a value for each action is learned.", "score": 0.810025, "scraped_at": "2025-10-28T20:38:48.299457"}
