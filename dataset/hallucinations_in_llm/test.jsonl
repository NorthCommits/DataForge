The recent advancements in neural network architectures, particularly transformers, have played a crucial role in the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models have enabled machines to generate new data (human-like), driving significant developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Large Language Models (LLMs) are a kind of AI that are trained on huge datasets [9], [10]. LLMs are advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing) models that use a deep neural network architecture designed to understand, generate, and process human language at a sophisticated level [11].", "score": 0.849865, "scraped_at": "2025-10-28T20:34:34.958915"}

Causes of Hallucinations in Large Language Models Some methods can help mitigate hallucinations in large language models. **By letting models check their responses against outside sources of quality information, we can significantly reduce hallucinations.** In this article, we learned that hallucinations are a significant challenge in large language models. The inherent limits of the training data and model architecture cause this problem. To tackle these challenges, we need better training data, model architectures that handle ambiguities, and real-time fact-checking.", "score": 0.772805, "scraped_at": "2025-10-28T20:34:34.958948"}
